# cubes-opengl-experience-rotation
course/opengl experience

I tried adding the files to the github, but the whole project was incremental and too many files were to be uploaded.
So the most important vertex shader, fragment shader, and main file was uploaded.
Just practiced using openGL.

below are images of what it would like if we use cmake and generate the release file.

Used cube mapping and rotations (below)

Used bump mapping in a way so that i get the shiny effect :D (below)
